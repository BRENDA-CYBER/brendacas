          Hi! I'm a junior developer with a strong passion for learning and
          improving my skills. I am eager to contribute to building meaningful
          web applications and solving real-world problems through clean,
          efficient code and grow my skills in web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience working with frontend technologies like React and
          JavaScript, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge of backend
          development with Node.js and Express.
